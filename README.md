# pygame-thing

For some reason I always make conglomerate one file monoliths for stuff when they are not projects.
Studying from this is probably not a good idea.
It works though. 

I seem to abuse lists and tuples somewhat extensively here.

Requires pygame which you can install with
PIP if you have it with
```
pip install pygame
```
